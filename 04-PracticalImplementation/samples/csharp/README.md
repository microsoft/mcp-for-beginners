# Practical Implementation

## Overview

This lesson focuses on practical aspects of MCP implementation. We'll explore how to use MCP SDKs in C# to build robust applications, debug and test MCP servers, and create reusable resources, prompts, and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement MCP solutions using official SDKs in various programming languages
- Debug and test MCP servers systematically
- Create and use server features (Resources, Prompts, and Tools)
- Design effective MCP workflows for complex tasks
- Optimize MCP implementations for performance and reliability
