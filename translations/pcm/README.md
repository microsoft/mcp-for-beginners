## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you go feel confident and excited about the new skills wey you don get. Here na wetin you go achieve:

• **Understand MCP fundamentals**: You go sabi wetin Model Context Protocol be and why e dey change how AI apps dey work together, with analogies and examples wey make sense.

• **Build your first MCP server**: You go create working MCP server for your own programming language, starting with easy examples then build your skills step by step.

• **Connect AI models to real tools**: You go learn how to join AI models with actual services, make your apps get strong new power.

• **Implement security best practices**: You go understand how to keep your MCP implementations safe and secure, protect your apps and users well.

• **Deploy with confidence**: You go sabi how to take your MCP projects go from development to production, with practical deployment plans wey work for real life.

• **Join the MCP community**: You go become part of big community of developers wey dey shape the future of AI app development.

## Essential Background

Before we dive for MCP details, make sure you dey comfortable with some basic concepts. No worry if you no be expert yet - we go explain everything you need as we go!

### Understanding Protocols (The Foundation)

Think protocol like the rules for talking. When you call your friend, both of you sabi say you go talk "hello" once you pick, take turns to talk, then talk "goodbye" when you finish. Computer programs also need rules like that to talk well.

MCP na protocol - na set of rules wey help AI models and apps get good "talk" with tools and services. Just like how talk rules make human talk easy, MCP dey make AI app communication sure and powerful well-well.

### Client-Server Relationships (How Programs Work Together)

You dey use client-server relationship every day! When you use web browser (client) to visit website, you dey connect to web server wey send you webpage. Browser sabi how to ask for info; server sabi how to respond.

For MCP, we get similar thing: AI models be clients wey dey ask for info or do things, MCP servers na those wey dey provide. E be like you get correct assistant (server) wey AI fit ask to do specific work.

### Why Standardization Matters (Making Things Work Together)

Imagine if every car maker dey use different shape gas pumps - you go need different adapter for each car! Standardization mean to agree on common way so things fit work together.

MCP dey provide this standardization for AI apps. Instead wen every AI model go need separate code to work with each tool, MCP create one correct way to communicate. Dis mean developers fit build tools once, and dem go fit work for many AI systems.

## 🧭 Your Learning Path Overview

Your MCP journey don set well to build your confidence and skills step by step. Each phase go bring new ideas plus make you strong with wetin you don learn.

### 🌱 Foundation Phase: Understanding the Basics (Modules 0-2)

Na here your waka start! We go introduce you to MCP concepts using familiar examples and simple ideas. You go understand wetin MCP be, why e dey, and how e fit inside bigger AI development world.
