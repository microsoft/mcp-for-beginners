## Case Study 6: NLWeb 
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol for Chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, which supports one core method, ask, which is used to ask a website a question in natural language. The returned response leverages schema.org, a widely-used vocabulary for describing web data. Loosely speaking, MCP is NLWeb as Http is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, Schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites rapidly create these endpoints, benefiting both humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent interaction.

There are two distinct components to NLWeb.
- A protocol, very simple to begin with, to interface with a site in natural language and a format, leveraging json and schema.org for the returned answer. See the documentation on the REST API for more details.
- A straightforward implementation of (1) that leverages existing markup, for sites that can be abstracted as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Together with a set of user interface widgets, sites can easily provide conversational interfaces to their content. See the documentation on Life of a chat query for more details on how this works.
