## Case Study 6: NLWeb

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol for chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, supporting one core method, ask, which allows asking a website a question in natural language. The returned response uses schema.org, a widely-used vocabulary for describing web data. Loosely speaking, MCP is to NLWeb as HTTP is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, Schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites quickly create these endpoints, benefiting both humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent interaction.

NLWeb has two main components:  
- A simple protocol to interface with a site in natural language, returning answers formatted with JSON and schema.org. See the REST API documentation for details.  
- A straightforward implementation of the protocol that leverages existing markup for sites that can be represented as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Combined with UI widgets, sites can easily provide conversational interfaces to their content. See the Life of a chat query documentation for more information.
