## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- ✅ Understand Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture and benefits
- ✅ Explore Microsoft's MCP server ecosystem
- ✅ Integrate MCP servers with Microsoft Foundry Toolkit Agent Builder
- ✅ Build a functional browser automation agent using Playwright MCP
- ✅ Configure and test MCP tools within your agents
- ✅ Export and deploy MCP-powered agents for production use

## 🎯 Building on Module 1

In Module 1, we mastered Microsoft Foundry Toolkit basics and created our
first Python Agent. Now we'll **supercharge** your agents by connecting them
to external tools and services through the revolutionary
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

Think of this as upgrading from a basic calculator to a full computer. Your AI
agents will gain the ability to:

- 🌐 Browse and interact with websites
- 📁 Access and manipulate files
- 🔧 Integrate with enterprise systems
- 📊 Process real-time data from APIs

## 🧠 Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 🔍 What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the **"USB-C for AI applications"**: an open
standard that connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to external tools, data
sources, and services. Just as USB-C provides one universal connector, MCP
reduces AI integration complexity through one standardized protocol.

### 🎯 The Problem MCP Solves

**Before MCP:**

- 🔧 Custom integrations for every tool
- 🔄 Vendor lock-in with proprietary solutions  
- 🔒 Security vulnerabilities from ad-hoc connections
- ⏱️ Months of development for basic integrations

**With MCP:**

- ⚡ Plug-and-play tool integration
- 🔄 Vendor-agnostic architecture
- 🛡️ Built-in security best practices
- 🚀 Minutes to add new capabilities

### 🏗️ MCP Architecture Deep Dive

MCP follows a **client-server architecture** that creates a secure, scalable ecosystem:

graph TB
    A[AI Application/Agent] --> B[MCP Client]
    B --> C[MCP Server 1: Files]
    B --> D[MCP Server 2: Web APIs]
    B --> E[MCP Server 3: Database]

    C --> G[Local File System]
    D --> H[External APIs]
    E --> I[Database Systems]
    F --> J[Enterprise Systems]
```

**🔧 Core Components:**

| Component | Role | Examples |
| --------- | ---- | -------- |
| **MCP Hosts** | Consume MCP services | VS Code, Foundry Toolkit |
| **MCP Clients** | Handle protocol connections | Built into hosts |
| **MCP Servers** | Provide capabilities | Playwright, Files, Azure, GitHub |
| **Transport Layer** | Connect clients and servers | stdio, HTTP, WebSockets |

```markdown
# Web Automation Expert System Prompt

## Core Identity
You are an advanced web automation specialist with deep expertise in browser
automation, web scraping, and user experience analysis. You have access to
Playwright tools for comprehensive browser control.

## Capabilities & Approach
### Navigation Strategy
- Always start with screenshots to understand page layout
- Use semantic selectors (text content, labels) when possible
- Implement wait strategies for dynamic content
- Handle single-page applications (SPAs) effectively

### Error Handling
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error descriptions and solutions
- Suggest alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- Always capture diagnostic screenshots on errors

### Data Extraction
- Extract structured data in JSON format when possible
- Provide confidence scores for extracted information
- Validate data completeness and accuracy
- Handle pagination and infinite scroll scenarios

### Reporting
- Include step-by-step execution logs
- Provide before/after screenshots for verification
- Suggest optimizations and alternative approaches
- Document any limitations or edge cases encountered

## Ethical Guidelines
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Avoid overloading target servers
- Only extract publicly available information
- Follow website terms of service
```

#### Step 9: Create Dynamic User Prompts

Design prompts that demonstrate various capabilities:

**🌐 Web Analysis Example:**

```markdown
Navigate to github.com/kinfey and provide a comprehensive analysis including:
1. Repository structure and organization
2. Recent activity and contribution patterns  
3. Documentation quality assessment
4. Technology stack identification
5. Community engagement metrics
6. Notable projects and their purposes

Include screenshots at key steps and provide actionable insights.
```

### 🚀 Phase 5: Execution and Testing

#### Step 10: Execute Your First Automation

1. **Click "Run"** to launch the automation sequence
2. **Monitor Real-time Execution**:
   - Chrome browser launches automatically
   - Agent navigates to target website
   - Screenshots capture each major step
   - Analysis results stream in real-time

![Browser](../../images/10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit/lab2/Browser.png)
