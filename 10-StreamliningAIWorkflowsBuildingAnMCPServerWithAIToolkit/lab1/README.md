## 🧪 Hands-on Exercise 1: Exploring Microsoft Foundry Models

**🎯 Objective**: Master the Model Catalog and test your first AI model

### 📊 Step 1: Navigate the Model Catalog

The Model Catalog is your gateway to the AI ecosystem. It aggregates models from multiple providers, making it easy to discover and compare options.

**🔍 Navigation Guide:**

Click on **MODELS - Catalog** in the Microsoft Foundry Toolkit sidebar

![Model Catalog](../../images/10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit/lab1/aimodel.png)

**💡 Pro Tip**: Look for models with specific capabilities that match your use case (e.g., code generation, creative writing, analysis).

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Models was retired on July 30, 2026. Use a Microsoft Foundry model
> deployment and authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID or an Azure API key.

### 🚀 Step 2: Add and Configure Your First Model

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- **GPT-5.1**: Recommended general-purpose model for tool use and reasoning
- **Phi-4-mini**: Lightweight, fast responses for simple tasks

**🔧 Configuration Process:**
1. Select **OpenAI GPT-5.1** from the catalog
2. Click **Add to My Models** - this registers the model for use
3. Choose **Try in Playground** to launch the testing environment
4. Wait for model initialization (first-time setup may take a moment)

![Playground Setup](../../images/10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit/lab1/playground.png)

**⚙️ Understanding Model Parameters:**
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length
- **Top-p**: Nucleus sampling for response diversity

### 🎯 Step 3: Master the Playground Interface

The Playground is your AI experimentation lab. Here's how to maximize its potential:

**🎨 Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed instructions yield better results
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Use Examples**: Show the model what you want with examples
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial results

**🧪 Testing Scenarios:**
```markdown
# Example 1: Code Generation
"Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. Include error handling and docstrings."

# Example 2: Creative Writing
"Write a professional email to a client explaining a project delay, maintaining a positive tone while being transparent about challenges."

# Example 3: Data Analysis
"Analyze this sales data and provide insights: [paste your data]. Focus on trends, anomalies, and actionable recommendations."
```

### 🏆 Challenge Exercise: Model Performance Comparison

**🎯 Goal**: Compare different models using identical prompts to understand their strengths

**📋 Instructions:**
1. Add **Phi-4-mini** to your workspace
2. Use the same prompt for both GPT-5.1 and Phi-4-mini

![set](../../images/10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit/lab1/set.png)

3. Compare response quality, speed, and accuracy
4. Document your findings in the results section

**💡 Key Insights to Discover:**
- When to use LLM vs SLM
- Cost vs. performance trade-offs
- Specialized capabilities of different models

## 🤖 Hands-on Exercise 2: Building Custom Agents with Agent Builder

**🎯 Objective**: Create specialized AI agents tailored for specific tasks and workflows

### 🏗️ Step 1: Understanding Agent Builder

Agent Builder is where Microsoft Foundry Toolkit truly shines. It allows you to create purpose-built AI assistants that combine the power of large language models with custom instructions, specific parameters, and specialized knowledge.

**🧠 Agent Architecture Components:**
- **Core Model**: The foundation LLM (GPT-5.1, Phi, etc.)
- **System Prompt**: Defines agent personality and behavior
- **Parameters**: Fine-tuned settings for optimal performance
- **Tools Integration**: Connect to external APIs and MCP services
- **Memory**: Conversation context and session persistence
